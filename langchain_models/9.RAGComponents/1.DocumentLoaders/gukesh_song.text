(Verse 1)
In the heart of Chennai, under the Indian sun,
A boy named Gukesh D, his journey had just begun.
With a chessboard in front, and dreams in his sight,
He played his heart out, day and night.

(Chorus)
Gukesh D, the pride of our land,
With a chessboard at his command.
He's won the Candidates, oh so grand,
Now for the World Championship, he makes his stand.

(Verse 2)
He became a Grandmaster, at such a tender age,
His passion for chess, you just can't gauge.
From the Asian Championships to the world stage,
His games are like poetry, page after page.

(Chorus)
Gukesh D, with intellect so bright,
In the world of chess, he's a shining light.
Against Ding Liren, he'll fight the fight,
For the World Championship title, with all his might.

(Bridge)
With every move, with every play,
He's writing history, in his own way.
The world watches as he slays,
In the royal game of chess, he's the king of the fray.

(Chorus)
Gukesh D, young and bold,
His story of triumph, to the world we've told.
In the World Championship, watch it unfold,
It's a battle of the minds, a sight to behold.

(Outro)
So here's to Gukesh, and his journey so far,
In the sky of chess, he's the brightest star.
No matter the outcome, he's raised the bar,
Gukesh D, you're a true avatar.
